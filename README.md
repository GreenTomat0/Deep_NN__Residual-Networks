# Deep Convolutional Network with Residual Networks (ResNets)

This repository implements a deep convolutional neural network based on Residual Networks (ResNets). The project is divided into three main components:

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>ResNet Identity Block</h3>
    <p>Architecture of the ResNet identity block:</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>ResNet-50 Model</h3>
    <p>A full ResNet model with 50 layers, implemented using the following architecture:</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Dataset and Training</h3>
<p>The model is trained on the SIGNS dataset, which contains images of hand signs representing numbers. This is the same dataset used in the Convolutional Neural Networks project.</p>
